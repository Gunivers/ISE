# REQUIREMENTS: 
# - Vars (Module)
# - Math (Module) 

# INPUT: 
# - Var1 (score dummy)
 
# OUTPUT: 
# - Res (score dummy) 
 
# NOTE:  
# - This function returns atan(Tmp1) in degrees (scaled by 1000), Tmp1 must be in interval [0;1000] instead of [0;1]
# - The maximum error of this function is 0.068 degrees
